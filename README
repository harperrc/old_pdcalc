N.B. i have discovered that you need to zero out d,wr and pod prior to
calling pdcalc with option 2 otherwise it will return the last 'good'
value if it computes a zero

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

for each driver there is a namelist that controls some of the parameters
the default name is drvX.nml where X = 1,2,3,4....

main <drivernumber> to run with the default file

main <drivernumber> -i filename to use an alternate namelist file

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

e.g. to run the code reading the gd.dat file
main 1

    drv1.x is the driver for this option

    namelist parameters are:

c  cep   circular error probable for weapon (km)
c  r95   95% of damage radius lies within this area (km)
c  gname file name containing ground range, altitude and yield data
c  ivns  starting vn #
c  ivne  ending vn #
c  ivnd  step in vn #
c  jti   target type
c  kfi   k-factor
c  iflg  1 product pod up to value of 0.990, d must be input
c        2 product pod up to value of 0.999, d must be input
c        3 see 4
c        4 produce weapon radius
c        5 see 6
c        6 produce d, maximum distance at which a give pod
c          can be acheived, pod must be input
c        7 produce fatality pod and casualty pod
c          returned in pod & wr, d must be input
c        8 damage sigma is input through pod variable pod is
c          output, d is input
c        9 damage sigma and weapon radius are input, pod is
c          output, d is input
c       10  wr input, pod is output, d is input
c  mode  which read to use
c        1 = grn,hob,yld
c            grn = ground range (ft)
c            hob = height of burst (ft)
c            yld = yield (Kt)
c         2 = grn,hob,yld,iv,jti,kfi
c            grn = ground range (ft)
c            hob = height of burst (ft)
c            yld = yield (Kt)
c            iv  = vulnerability number
c            jti = type (e.g. 'p','q',....) N.B. MUST BE LOWER CASE
c            kfi = vulnerability number k-factor
c  gamma reentry angle assumed 
c  az    azimuth iin degrees from dgz to target

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

main 2 exercises the code across some vn, kf

    drv2.x is the driver for this option

    namelist parameters are:

c  hobi  height of burst for evaluation (ft)
c  cep   circular error probable for weapon (km)
c  r95   95% of damage radius lies within this area (km)
c  gname file name containing ground range, altitude and yield data
c  ivnb  starting vn #
c  ivne  ending vn #
c  ivns  step in vn #
c  jti   target type
c  kfb   k-factor begin value (typically 0)
c        the end value will be min(ivn-1,9)
c  kfs   k-factor step (typicall 1)
c  az    azimuth iin degrees from dgz to target

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

main 3 reads a reformatted version of your OPEN-RISOP file (my name is good)
and computes pod with a yield of 300kt and a cep or 3 nmi

    drv3.x is the driver for this option

    namelist parameters are:

c  yld   yield (kt)
c  hobi  height of burst for evaluation (ft)
c  cep   circular error probable for weapon (km)
c  fname name of reformatted RISOP file

c        fields (can be read free format since no character data)
c           line,catcode,xlat,xlon,hgt,r95,vntk,ivn,jti,kfi

c                  line   line # in file (usefull to reference back to original file)
c                  xlat   latitude (deg)
c                  xlon   longtude (deg)
c                  hgt    height (ft)

c                  vntk   full vntk (e.g. 10P0)
c                  ivn    vn number portion only
c                  jti    type (e.g. p,q,r....) N.B. MUST BE LOWER CASE
c                  kfi    k-factor

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

main 4 reads a list of available vn number with associated cep and
       a file of icbm parameters and then loops over height of burst
       to determine pod

    drv4.x is the driver for this option

    namelist parameters are:


c  iname  filename containing icbm information
c         this file requires a strict format as follows
